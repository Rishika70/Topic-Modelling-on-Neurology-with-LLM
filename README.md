# Topic-Modelling-on-Neurology-with-LLM
The provided code implements a system for generating research prompts and analyzing documents related to neurology, incorporating several NLP techniques. Let's break down its components and compare it to traditional topic modeling:

**Code Functionality:**

1. **Research Prompt Generation:**  The code defines a function `generate_research_prompts` that creates research questions based on a specified category (e.g., "Disease," "Treatment," "Technology") and a list of keywords. This is a crucial step for guiding research and analysis.

2. **Semantic Similarity and Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**  The code uses Sentence Transformers (`paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to calculate semantic similarity between a given question and a set of documents. This helps identify the most relevant documents for answering the question. The `chain_of_thought_answer` function then ranks documents based on their similarity to the question and constructs a summary of relevant excerpts, imitating a human-like reasoning process.

3. **BERT-based Cosine Similarity:** In addition to Sentence Transformers, the code leverages BERT (`bert-base-uncased`) to calculate cosine similarity between the question and documents. This provides another measure of semantic similarity. The code uses BERT's contextualized word representations for more refined comparisons.


**Comparison to Traditional Topic Modeling:**

Traditional topic modeling techniques (like Latent Dirichlet Allocation - LDA) aim to discover underlying topics within a collection of documents. They represent documents as mixtures of topics, and topics as distributions of words.  The core difference lies in their purpose and approach:

* **Purpose:** Traditional topic modeling is primarily *unsupervised*. It's about discovering hidden themes or subjects within a corpus *without* specific queries or questions in mind. The provided code, on the other hand, is more *query-driven*.  It focuses on answering specific questions by finding relevant information within a document set.

* **Approach:** Topic modeling identifies topics based on word co-occurrence patterns. The code uses pre-trained language models (Sentence Transformers and BERT) to understand the *meaning* and *semantic relationship* between words and sentences, making it more nuanced than simple word counts. The concept of "chain-of-thought" adds another layer by mimicking a reasoning process to prioritize the most pertinent parts of documents in answering a specific question. Topic models don't typically provide ranked documents or chain-of-thought summaries in response to a question.

* **Output:** Topic modeling outputs a set of topics and their associated words, along with topic distributions for each document.  The provided code's output is a targeted answer to a specific question, summarizing the relevant parts of documents based on semantic similarity.

**In Summary:**

The code offers a more targeted and question-answering oriented approach to text analysis compared to the broader topic discovery provided by traditional topic modeling techniques. The use of powerful sentence embeddings and the "chain-of-thought" concept allows the code to provide more contextually relevant answers based on specific research prompts or queries.
